I've used the Bantam Tools desktop mill and the Type A machines 3D printer, which is what you'll find g-code included for.

The vector graphics source files are also included. Sorry I used such weird software for this one... the milling toolpath is set up with V-Carve, and the vector art is originally an Illustrator file, also included here in other formats. The alignment jig was designed in Rhino, but I've included an STL.
